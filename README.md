**This program is not responsible for any damage caused**  
**If you encrypt a file with a password, then subsequently forget the said password, the file may be unrecoverable.**  

## Why Aegis?
* Aegis encrypts files with AES-256 bit encryption, one of the best encryption algorithm that is publicly available at this time
* Encryption is all done in RAM, this program doesn't create any copies of the original file, the encryption data is used to override the original file

## Is this file safe?
[VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/bc4c2f3a232ff35b9daa48c67e102f677b3f7f568885cce258d2d7308ae2c8a8/detection) is a trusted online service that scans files and links with 60+ different antiviruses, as you can see from the result in the link, this file is completely safe.

## How to Use
Simply download the project files onto your desktop, then run "Aegis.exe". After dragging or importing files into the application, go to File -> Encrypt to encrypt the file(s) that you've selected. A green glow around the file in the application means success, while a red glow means failure.

## Notice
* Although folders are registered as valid in the application, they will not be encrypted (will be added in the near feature)
* You can encrypt a file that is already encrypted, you would need to decrypt it multiple times to retrieve the original file
